Support Vector Machines

# Problem:
Using the Abalone csv file, create a new notebook to build an experiment using support vector machine classifier and regression.

# Abstract:
Kennedy's oceanographic institute client pulled into port the other day with a ton (literally) of collected samples and corresponding data to process. Some of these data tasks are being distributed to others to work on; you've got the abalone (marine snails) data to classify and determine the age from physical characteristics. 

The analysis is is divided the following way:

### Data Exploration
- **Visual Exploration of the variables**
    - Categorical Variable
    - Numerical Variables
- **Formatting the variables**
    - One Hot Encoding
    - Binary Variable

### Analysis
- **SVC review**
    - Split Data Set
    - Hyperparameter Settings for SVC
    - Performance Evaluation of the SVC Model
- **SVR review**
    - Split Data Set
    - Hyperparameter Settings for SVR
    - Performance Evaluation of the SVR Model
        
### Summary of Models Performance
